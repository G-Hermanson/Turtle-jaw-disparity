# This folder includes:

- *Supplementary files*: files associated with the manuscript
- `Supplementary File S1 (Raw data).csv`: input data containing functional measurements of turtle jaws, specimen info, clade and ecological assignments
- `Stubbs_data.csv`: functional measurements of pseudosuchian jaws extracted from Stubbs et al. ([2013](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.1940)), used to compare opening and closing mechanical advantage values with turtle values
- `Supplementary File S3 (Character matrix).csv`: input character-state matrix of 51 characters and 77 taxa obtained from Evers et al. ([2023](https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.25037)) and expanded (see Main Text), used in discrete morphology ordination and disparity analyses
- `Script_1_turtle_biomech_measurements.R`: `R` script used to read biomechanics data and produce summary statistcs as well as running PCA and disparity analyses
- `Script_2_turtle_discrete_char.R`: `R` script used to read character-state matrix data and run PCoA and disparity analyses
- `Script_3_figures.R`: `R` script used to produce figures in the Main Text and supplementary figures. Later edited in Adobe Illustrator for e.g., removal of unnecessary blank space
